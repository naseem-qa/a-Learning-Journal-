# JavaScript
---
**JavaScript (JS)** this book talking about js.  
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
## EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions
## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values
## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class.

## FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS
Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:
FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS BUILT-IN
METHODS OBJECTS
**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
