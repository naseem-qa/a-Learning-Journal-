# What makes a computer a computer?
----
itâ€™s like a tool human being use to help in different life
the basic concept of how it works is input processing and output
till now it works as same as the old machine
how info represent in computer
the smallest piece of info is a bit
the basic of how binary system like an electricity wire that you can turn it on or off
with 8 wires you can get 255 number
using a binary system U can represent any num U like
text in binary; it represent the letter with a number then translate the num into binary
for the images and graphics it made of teeny pixels, each one has a color, each of the color represented by a num
sound come as a waves, the wave made of top and bottom points inside the chart, these point represented by numbers which also can translated to binary
Circuits and Logic
uses the circuits to combine the input of ones and zeros
there are several types of circuits like: and, or and not circuits
can make complicated circuits
it provides simple calculation like addition or subtraction
the small the circuit is the short the line bt the operation is
CPU, Input and Output
each one done by different part of the comp.
input devices: take input from the outside and convert it into binary info
memory to store inf
cpu do the processing
output take the info and confirm it to a physical info.
there are different types of input and output devices.
software and hardware
the hardware is the physical device that we can see and touch
the software that what we don't see like apps and games
these to is interacting through cpu
cpu it has different circuits to do different operations.
the magic of cpu is how it knows what circuit to use
binary commands stored in memory and the cpu you start with them one by one in sequence.
