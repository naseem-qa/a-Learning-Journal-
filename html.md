**GH17**
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google

**GH**
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The **div** and  **span** elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- **iframes** cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The **meta** tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
