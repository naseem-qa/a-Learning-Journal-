CH11: Color IN CSS
We learn about colors in this chapter  will then be
used in colors of text and boxes in CSS.

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
1. RGB Values:
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
2. Hex Codes:
Hex values represent values;for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code
3. Color Names:
Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number

- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

-  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
